The Tyranid splinter fleet had broken through the outer defense grid of Macragge. Captain Titus deployed his forces to defend the critical Eastern Gate Complex, the last barrier before the capital hive. The aliens had to be stopped here.

Deployment saw the Ultramarines taking defensive positions among the ruins, while the Tyranids massed for a frontal assault across the open ground.

## Post-Battle Thoughts

A close-fought battle that showcased the relentless nature of the Tyranid threat. The Ultramarines' disciplined fire and tactical flexibility proved just enough to hold the line. The Dreadnought was the MVP, absorbing incredible punishment while dealing out devastating firepower.

The Tyranids' speed was impressive but their lack of ranged anti-tank weapons cost them when dealing with the Repulsor. A thrilling game that came down to the final turn!
