# Contributing to Vis Aquilaei

Welcome to the Vis Aquilaei repository! This guide will help you contribute battle reports, fluff texts, and other content.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** or get write access from the maintainer
2. **Choose your content type**:
   - Battle reports go in `/battle-reports/`
   - Narrative/lore content goes in `/fluff-texts/`
   - Images go in `/images/` with appropriate subdirectories
3. **Use the templates** in `/templates/` for consistency

## File Naming Conventions

### Battle Reports
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`
- Example: `2024-01-15-siege-of-macragges-gate.md`
- Date should be when the battle was played, not written

### Fluff Texts
Format: `descriptive-title.md`
- Example: `last-stand-of-sergeant-varro.md`
- Use lowercase with hyphens instead of spaces

### Images
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.extension` or `army-name-unit.extension`
- Example: `2024-01-15-macragge-deployment.jpg`
- Example: `ultramarines-captain-titus.png`
