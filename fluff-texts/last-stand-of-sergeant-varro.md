# The Last Stand of Sergeant Varro

The promethium flames cast dancing shadows across the ruined factorum as Sergeant Varro of the Cadian 47th checked his lasgun's power pack one final time. Barely a quarter charge remained—enough for perhaps twenty shots, if he was careful.

Behind him, the wounded trooper Kellus groaned softly. The las-blast had taken most of his left leg, but the young soldier was still breathing. That was something, at least.

"Sarge," Kellus whispered, his voice barely audible over the distant rumble of approaching tracks. "How many?"

Varro peered through the shattered window. In the orange glow of the burning hive, he could make out the silhouettes of at least two dozen heretic guardsmen advancing in loose formation. Their crude eight-pointed stars glinted malevolently in the firelight.

"Enough to matter," he replied grimly.

The Cadian raised his weapon and centered the iron sights on the lead traitor. The man was maybe eighty meters out—an easy shot for a Shock Trooper of his caliber. But every shot had to count now.

"For Cadia," he murmured, and squeezed the trigger.

The las-beam struck true, dropping the heretic instantly. The others scattered, seeking cover among the twisted metal debris. But Varro was already moving, having memorized their positions in those crucial seconds.

Shot. Move. Shot. Move.

Each beam found its mark. Each fallen traitor bought precious seconds. Behind him, Kellus was speaking into the vox-caster with fumbling hands, calling for extraction that might never come.

When the power pack finally died with a hollow click, only six heretics remained. Varro drew his knife and checked the frag grenades on his belt. Two left.

In the distance, a Valkyrie's engines could be heard approaching.

Almost time.
